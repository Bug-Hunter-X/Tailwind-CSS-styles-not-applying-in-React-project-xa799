# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying in React Project

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when integrating Tailwind CSS into React projects: styles failing to apply despite seemingly correct setup.

## Problem

The Tailwind directives are correctly imported (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`), and the classes are used in the React component, but the corresponding styles are not rendering.

## Solution

This issue often arises from build configuration issues or incorrect build processes. The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind's build process correctly processes your CSS and injects the necessary styles into your application.

The solution provided in this repository implements a fix related to how Tailwind postcss process is configured, providing clear instructions on how to rectify the problem.
